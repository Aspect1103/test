## How to run

### Pre-compiled releases (preferred)

The preferred and easiest way to play Hades is by using the pre-compiled
releases on GitHub. rTo play the game this way, follow these steps:

1. Download and extract the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Aspect1103/Hades/releases).
2. Run the `window.exe` file to play the game.

### Locally

Another way to play Hades is by cloning the repository and running it locally.
To play the game this way, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone
   https://github.com/Aspect1103/Hades.git`.
2. Ensure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed and virtual
   environments are created in the project directory using `poetry config
   virtualenvs.in-project true --local`.
3. Run `poetry install --no-dev` to install the dependencies needed to run the
   game.
4. Run the `window.py` file in the `hades` directory to play the game.
   Optionally, you can run `python hades` in the CLI (make sure the virtual
   environment is active first).

While this way is more convoluted and unstable, it will allow you to access the
latest version of the game with the newest features.

## Building the game

You can also compile the game locally if you choose. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone
   https://github.com/Aspect1103/Hades.git`.
2. Ensure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed and virtual
   environments are created in the project directory using `poetry config
   virtualenvs.in-project true --local`.
3. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies needed to build the game.
4. Either run the `build.py` file or run `python -m build.py` to build the game
   locally. Optionally, you can run `make build` if you have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
   installed.
